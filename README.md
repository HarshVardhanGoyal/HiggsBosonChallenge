# HiggsBosonChallenge
This project is based on the Higgs Boson Dataset where ensemble models and Deep Learning models are implemented to see which of them work more efficiently.
The Higgs Boson Dataset is a 30 featured dataset comprising of two events: Signal events and Background Events. The Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge was organized to promote collaboration between high energy physicists and data scientists. The ATLAS experiment at CERN provided simulated data that has been used by physicists in a search for the Higgs boson. The Challenge was organized by a small group of ATLAS physicists and data scientists. It was hosted by Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson ; the challenge data is now available on http://opendata.cern.ch/collection/ATLAS-Higgs-Challenge-2014 . This paper provides the physics background and explores the different ensemble models of Machine learning on the dataset and see if the models are comparable amongst each other based on the ROC-AUC curve. We also implement a RNN model and calculate our AMS score based on that to further analyze our results. Keywords: high energy physics, Higgs boson, RNN, Ensemble, Machine learning.
